\begin{abstract}
        This document describes the capabilities of the 
        \texttt{refart} and \texttt{refrep} classes for \LaTeXe. 
        These classes do not work with \LaTeX\ 2.09. They contain some 
        improvements over the original \texttt{refman} style which may result 
        in different output and minor incompatibilities, but make refman 
        work with paper sizes other than ISO A4, which I consider an 
        improvement.
\end{abstract}


This manual is an addition to chapter~5 (``Designing It Yourself'') of 
the \LaTeX-manual by Leslie Lamport.  It was originally written in 
1988 by Hubert Partl and updated by me during the development of 
\texttt{refman}~2.0.  The translation into English was done in summer 
1998, almost 10 years after the initial release in German.
