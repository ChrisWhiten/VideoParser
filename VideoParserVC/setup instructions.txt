"you can configure the location for the ipch files, although it is a global setting and not per solution.  It also configures where the SDF file is placed.  To do this, go to Tools|Options|TextEditor|C/C++|Advanced and set the "Always Use Fallback Location" to true and set the "Fallback Location" to the directory to use.  The next time you open a solution you will use this directory (a subdir per solution is created) after being prompted to confirm."
